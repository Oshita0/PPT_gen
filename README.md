🧠 AI-Based PowerPoint Generator

The AI-Based PowerPoint Generator is a smart automation tool that creates complete, well-structured, and visually consistent PowerPoint presentations directly from real-time web data.
It’s designed to simplify the process of making presentations — transforming a single topic input into a polished deck in seconds.

This project integrates three key components:
	•	DuckDuckGo Search (DDGS): Gathers relevant and up-to-date contextual information from the web.
	•	Ollama’s LLaMA2 Model: Generates meaningful and coherent content for slides using local AI inference.
	•	Python-pptx: Automatically builds and formats the slides with proper structure, headings, and bullet points.

The system works entirely offline, ensuring data privacy and fast performance. With a simple prompt, users can generate 5–7 slides — including a title, overview, key points, and a conclusion — in under 10 seconds.

Built as a modular and reusable pipeline, it’s suitable for educators, students, researchers, and professionals who frequently prepare topic-based presentations and want to save time without compromising quality.

✨ Key Features
